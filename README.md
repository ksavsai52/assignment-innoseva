# assignment-innoseva

This project was created and tested in Eclipse IDE. So, for testing, please run it in Eclipse IDE.
Tools used in the project:
1- MVC Architecture using jsp and servlet.
2- csv file to store user details (first name, last name, phone number, address).
3- File handling to read data from csv file.
4- Bootstrap framework for design.
5- Apache Tomcat 7.0 server.

Steps to run the project:
1- Download the zip file and open the project using Eclipse IDE.
2- Run the project on server. Apache Tomcat 7.0 and higher would be great.
3- The styling I have used may not work efficiently in Eclipse browser, so I recommend using Google Chrome or Mozilla to view the result.
4- Here are four inputs you can use to test:
      firstName,lastName,phoneNumber,address
   -> keshav,shahi,9841609902,bhaktapur
   -> abc,def,1234567890,abcdef
   -> ghi,jkl,0987654321,ghijkl
   -> mno,pqr,9876543210,mnopqr

I hope, you get the desired result.
Thank you.
